# Flashcard Player
It's a flashcard player app for you to use with your own flashcard CSV files!
Yes, you can freely import your own definitions or words that you want to revise into this app and go through them all conveniently.
This can be used to review various topics, depending on what you want to do with it, I obviously do not have control over that.

## Getting Started
To get this running on your own computer, do the following!


## How to use the app?
1. After starting the program, use the top button to load your .csv file, it needs to have two columns (questions/answers), and no header row as it will also end up being added to the flashcards player.
2. A set of sample flashcards are already inside the app, which you can test before inserting your own files. The folder also includes two sets of flashcards (as .csv files) for you to use as well.
3. Use the "Show Answer" button to reveal the answer to a question in the flashcard set.
4. Use the "<--" and "-->" buttons to go through all of your flashcards.
5. Enjoy!
