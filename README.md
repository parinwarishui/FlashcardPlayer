# Flashcard Player
This is a simple flashcards player app, which you can input a CSV file with two rows (the former being the questions, and the latter being the answer) to use the program. This can be used to review certain topics, totally depending on what you want to do with it.

## How to use the app?
1. After starting the program, use the top button to load your .csv file, it needs to have two columns (questions/answers), and no header row as it will also end up being added to the flashcards player.
2. Use the "Show Answer" button to reveal the answer to a question in the flashcard set.
3. Use the "<--" and "-->" buttons to go through all of your flashcards.
4. Enjoy!
